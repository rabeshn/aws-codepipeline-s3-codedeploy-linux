												DOMINIC KING: Jurgen Klopp's presence at a Liverpool youth game shortly
												after his appointment in 2015 (left) was an easy opportunity to gain
												some quick, positive PR but the truth was different. He made a public
												commitment to the academy that day, a promise that there would be a
												pathway to the first team if the kids were good enough. 'I can promise
												that before we sign a player who isn't a lot better than what we already
												have we will always use our own boys,' Klopp would tell Sportsmail in
												October 2016. 'That's how the future should be – even in the crazy
												football transfer world. We want to be this special club.' Here we are,
												four years on, and Klopp's vision is becoming a reality. For all that
												there has been debate over how Liverpool have dealt with some of their
												fixture issues this season, not least the FA Cup replay with Shrewsbury,
												one fact is inescapable: Anfield is a place where youth flourishes.
												Pictured centre, Liverpool's youngsters celebrate their win over
												Shrewsbury and right, academy graudate Trent Alexander-Arnold with the
												Champions League trophy.

													PETE JENSON IN SPAIN: Eric Abidal has kept his job at Barcelona
													despite upsetting the club's most important player Lionel Messi.
													Barcelona's Technical Secretary had a two-hour meeting with
													president Josep Bartomeu on Wednesday night and was told his job was
													safe. Meanwhile Messi's spectacular fall-out with Abidal is unlikely
													to pave the way for a last-ditch bid to bring him to the Premier
													League from Manchester City.

													Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse was taken off on a
													stretcher and given oxygen after being caught on the right leg by a
													late challenge from Ryan Sessegnon, inset. Ward-Prowse was in so
													much pain he grabbed onto team-mate Danny Ings while he was being
													treated for the injury, with pictures appearing to show a deep gash
													in his leg after being caught by Sessegnon, who appeared shaken in
													the aftermath. Television mics caught Saints striker Shane Long
													shouting 'f*** me, you can see his f****** bone' as he went over to
													check on his team-mate.

													MATT BARLOW AT THE TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM: Jose Mourinho was
													hired at great expense to win trophies, to end the long wait for
													Tottenham and convince players they might be able to fulfil their
													ambitions without moving on. Spurs were already out of the Carabao
													Cup and far adrift in the Premier League. They progressed in the
													Champions League but there was no question which was as the most
													achievable target. Mourinho fixed his sights on the FA Cup and his
													team are another step closer.

													Champions League success is the priority for Thomas Tuchel (left)
													this season, but fresh spats with his stars Neymar (right) and
													Kylian Mbappe (centre) could derail PSG's campaign and put his job
													on the line. Mbappe was furious when substituted by Tuchel on the
													weekend against Montpellier, a move which undermined his leadership
													and made it look as though he is unable to control his players. The
													two shared a hug (inset) on Tuesday night, but that won't silence
													the doubters.

													EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY MATT BARLOW: Sam Allardyce sinks into a sofa
													and talks about the jobs he loved and the jobs he lost. And of those
													which never were. But the job which might tempt him back into
													business he finds harder to define. Allardyce spent 167 days at
													Everton (inset right). He led them from 13th in the Premier League
													to eighth before he was replaced by Marco Silva, who was himself
													replaced 18 months later by Carlo Ancelotti. 'Looking back I was
													always going to be the stop-gap,' he admits. 'I didn't know that in
													the beginning but I found out later on. Marco Silva was always going
													to come in. I don't think anyone expected them to do so badly.' Pep
													Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp (inset left), he points out, are not
													afraid to go direct and launch the ball long and inject variation
													into their style. 'Liverpool play long ball very well indeed from
													right to left, and very quickly,' says Allardyce. 'But nobody will
													say Liverpool play long ball. 'You wouldn't hear Martin Tyler saying
													it because it would be frowned upon.'

													Matthijs de Ligt is akin to 'a Rembrandt'. Comparing Pogba to a
													piece of work from the American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, Raiola
													told Belgian site Sport Voetbal Magazine that he similarities due to
													their ability to express themselves.

													MARK WILSON AT IBROX: What a way to set about making a name in your
													own right. And on the old man's birthday, too. Just as it seemed
													Rangers' title hopes were about to fade to grey, Ianis Hagi marked
													his full debut with a challenge-saving strike. Six minutes were all
													that was left when the ball dropped to his right foot inside the
													area. A precise, angled finish zipped beyond Ofir Marciano and sent
													a wave of jubilant relief surging around Ibrox. Dad Gheroghe was
													busy blowing out candles after turning 55 on Wednesday. Having
													already hailed Rangers as the right club to advance his son's
													career, Romania's greatest-ever player would doubtless have been
													proud of the response delivered at his new team's moment of greatest
													need.

													Dimitri Payet scored a contender for goal of the season in France on
													Wednesday after netting from a near impossible angle in Marseille's
													win over St Etienne. Marseille moved six points clear in second
													place in Ligue 1 with a comfortable 2-0 victory. But it was former
													West Ham star Payet who stole the headlines with an exquisite finish
													for Marseille's opening goal after seven minutes.

													Bayern Munich's in-form hitman Robert Lewandowski struck twice as
													they saw off fellow Bundesliga side Hoffenheim 4-3 at home on
													Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals of the German Cup. Holders
													Bayern fell behind when Jerome Boateng diverted a shot into his own
													net in the eighth minute but they soon levelled with an own goal by
													Hoffenheim's Benjamin Hubner before Thomas Mueller put them in front
													with a volley in the 20th minute. Lewandowski stretched Bayern's
													lead further in the 36th minute and looked to have wrapped the game
													up when he struck again with 10 minutes remaining, netting for the
													35th time in all competitions this season.

													PETE JENSON IN SPAIN: One unsettled club legend who is free to leave
													in the summer. One struggling sporting director now likely to be
													sacked. One under-pressure president being forced into early
													elections this summer and one €120m winger who has only ever played
													10 complete games since signing and is now out injured until the end
													of the season. Barcelona is a club in crisis with Lionel Messi, Eric
													Abidal and Josep Maria Bartomeu at war and Ousmane Dembele once
													again on the treatment table. Sportsmail asks how it came to this
													and what happens next.
